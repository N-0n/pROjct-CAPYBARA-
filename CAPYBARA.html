      <h1 style="color:#221008">CAPYBARAS</h1>

      <p >These impressive semi-aquatic mammals are found throughout much of northern and central South America, though a small
     invasive population has been seen in Florida. They're closely related to guinea pigs and rock cavies, and more distantly
     related to chinchillas and agouti.</p>

     <p id="p22">Like beavers, capybaras are strong swimmers. Their pig-shaped bodies are adapted for life in bodies of water found in
    forests, seasonally flooded savannas, and wetlands. Their toes are partially webbed for paddling around, and their
    reddish to dark brown fur is long and brittleâ€”perfect for drying out quickly on land. Small eyes, noses, and hairless
    ears are located high on their heads so that their faces remain exposed and alert when most of their body is submerged.</p>
